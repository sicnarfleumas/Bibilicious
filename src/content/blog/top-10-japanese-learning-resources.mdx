The most challenging part about studying a language as intensive as Japanese is finding resources that align with your needs and study methods. As someone who loves scouring the internet for apps and websites to make studying more enjoyable and effective, I can’t help but share some of the incredible finds that I hope will be just as helpful to you!

## 1. Tofugu

**Topic:** Grammar, Learning Resources, Japan, Travel, Language Learning

**Link:** [Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/)

Any language learner has, at least once, looked up the infamous line "where to start," and one of the first links to pop up is Tofugu's "Learn Japanese: A Ridiculously Detailed Guide” [Learn Japanese Guide](https://www.tofugu.com/learn-japanese/).

This website is a goldmine for people of all levels, especially for those who constantly search for things like grammar breakdowns, curated study materials, and How-To guides like myself.

- Access completely free content at your fingertips.
- User-friendly and easy to understand articles.
- Features a cool interface.
- A must-have for Japanese learners and Japan lovers.
- Free of charge.

## 2. Wani Kani

**Topic:** Kanji Learning, SRS, Vocabulary, Mnemonics

**Link:** [Wani Kani](https://www.wanikani.com/)

This is an application developed by the founder of Tofugu. It is a Japanese radicals, kanji, and vocabulary learning web app that utilizes mnemonics and SRS (Spaced Repetition System) to simplify kanji learning. Similar to Anki, it employs mnemonics to aid in remembering patterns and words through two-line story-like sentences.

- A fast and effective method to study Kanji.
- Makes Kanji recognition through radicals easier.
- Fun, comprehensive, and engaging.
- An easy way to maintain and increase vocabulary.
- Payment required.

## 3. Jisho

**Topic:** Dictionary App/Website, Word lists, JLPT

**Link:** [Jisho](#)

You probably saw this one coming, but the list would be incomplete without it. Personally, this app is one of the best dictionary apps I have used, especially considering there are others out there that are just as good. Take "Japanese," for example. What sets this app apart is its user-friendly interface, the breakdown of lists based on the frequency of kanji/words, categorized by JLPT level, and the inclusion of example sentences for each vocabulary. The other word lists include expressions (idiomatic and proverbs), slangs and dialects, colloquialisms, obsolete terms, words usually written in kana alone and so much more. While these features are not uncommon, I feel like Jisho somehow does it better. Additionally, the website is a plus as it allows for easy access to your account and the ability to look up words while working on your computer or laptop.

- User-friendly interface
- Available on both website and app
- Access to unlimited word lists for learning
- JLPT kanji and vocabulary lists included
- Flashcards feature
- Free of charge

## 4. Learn Japanese 先生

**Topic:** App/Website, Grammar, Vocabulary, Textbook, Blog

**Link:** [Learn Japanese Sensei (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/learn-japanese-sensei/id1495789984) | [Learn Japanese Sensei (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.japanactivator.android.jasensei&hl=en&gl=US)

This app version Tae Kim's *Guide to Learning Japanese* is one of the best grammar guides available. It is a valuable resource that can be used no matter your Japanese proficiency. Unlike most textbooks that teach Japanese using the grammatical structure of English, this book follows the "Japanese through Japanese" learning approach, making it a unique and effective tool for language learning.

- Suitable for absolute beginners
- Provides clear and simple explanations of grammar
- Easy to use for all users
- Free of charge

## 5. Organic Japanese with Cure Dolly

**Topic:** Youtube, Grammar, Vocabulary, Guides and Books

**Link:** [Cure Dolly's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdmU8hGK4Fg3LghTVtKltQ)

A similar approach is taken by the anonymous YouTuber/”sentient, self-aware intelligence” who goes by the name Cure Dolly, whose content aims to make Japanese as simple as it really is. Another valuable resource for learners of all levels. Cure Dolly breaks down the semantics of Japanese as a language and provides easy to follow explanations of grammar within its fundamental context. The channel also offers hacks and tricks for learning Kanji or vocabulary more efficiently, giving its learners plenty of options to choose from.

## 6. Yomu Jp

**Topic:** Website, Reading, Vocabulary, Culture, Knowledge, JLPT

**Link:** [Yomu Jp](https://yomujp.com/)

For those looking for a level-appropriate resource to improve your reading skills, Yomu Jp is just the place. What makes it interesting is that the articles are divided based on the difficulty level corresponding to the JLPT, both in terms of grammar and vocabulary. Each article varies in subject matter from level to level. For instance, the articles listed in N4 would have subjects or stories that are easier to comprehend compared to those found in N1, which are intended for a more advanced audience.

- Suitable for all levels of proficiency.
- Levels specifically designed for absolute beginners.
- Enhance your understanding of Japanese culture and society.
- User-friendly and intuitive.
- Ideal for individuals starting their reading journey.
- Free of charge

## 7. Kakimashou

**Topic:** Website, Dictionary, Kanji, JLPT, Vocabulary

**Link:** [Kakimashou](https://www.kakimashou.com/)

Dictionaries are fun, but Kakimashou takes it to the next level by focusing on memorizing kanji through writing. When you type in a word, it displays its meaning and provides a square grid with dotted lines, similar to genkouyoushi paper, for you to practice writing the kanji. You can choose to view the stroke order multiple times before attempting to write it yourself. The computer recognizes your strokes based on the accuracy of your writing. This method is more enjoyable than traditional paper practice, making it highly recommended.

It also provides a curriculum that includes kanji lists from JLPT, WaniKani, and vocabularies from textbooks such as Heisig's Remembering the Kanji, Genki, and others. The dictionary displays the breakdown of kanji by radical and indicates the frequency of each kanji's usage in everyday life.

- Kanji Learning and Kanji Writing Dictionary
- Vocabulary lists from popular websites and textbooks
- Suitable
