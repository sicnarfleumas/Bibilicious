The most challenging part about studying a language as intensive as Japanese is finding resources that align with your needs and study methods. As someone who loves scouring the internet for apps and websites to make studying more enjoyable and effective, I can’t help but share some of the incredible finds that I hope will be just as helpful to you!

## 1. Tofugu

**Topic:** Grammar, Learning Resources, Japan, Travel, Language Learning
**Link:** [Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/)

Any language learner has, at least once, looked up the infamous line "where to start," and one of the first links to pop up is Tofugu's "Learn Japanese: A Ridiculously Detailed Guide” [Learn Japanese Guide](https://www.tofugu.com/learn-japanese/).

This website is a goldmine for people of all levels, especially for those who constantly search for things like grammar breakdowns, curated study materials, and How-To guides like myself.

The interface is just as enticing as the content it offers. However, for someone just starting out, the amount of content the website offers can be a little overwhelming. Nevertheless, I have discovered that the more you visit the site, the more it becomes your go-to resource for any type of content you need. There are also numerous articles not only about Japanese as a language but also about Japan and its culture. So, if you are someone who loves staying updated on the latest news and wants to show off your cultural and/or language knowledge to your Japanese friends, Tofugu is the perfect place for you.

- Access completely free content at your fingertips.
- User-friendly and easy to understand articles.
- Features a cool interface.
- A must-have for Japanese learners and Japan lovers.
- Free of charge.

## 2. Wani Kani

**Topic:** Kanji Learning, SRS, Vocabulary, Mnemonics
**Link:** [Wani Kani](https://www.wanikani.com/)

This is an application developed by the founder of Tofugu. It is a Japanese radicals, kanji, and vocabulary learning web app that utilizes mnemonics and SRS (Spaced Repetition System) to simplify kanji learning. Similar to Anki, it employs mnemonics to aid in remembering patterns and words through two-line story-like sentences.

The app includes a total of 60 levels or lessons, with the first four being free. If you want to continue, there are various subscription packages to choose from, ranging from annual to lifetime, and offering multiple payment methods. By completing all 60, you will have mastered approximately 2000 kanji and 6000 vocabulary words, which is sufficient to read a newspaper or novel with relative ease.

I have tried several methods to study Kanji, but nothing has proven as efficient and worthwhile as Wani Kani. Simply put, I find that it **breaks down the learning process better than any other app or website out there**. My personal favourite is the variety of context sentences it provides for vocabularies. It helps to understand how a particular word is used in both a societal and cultural context. Additionally, it serves as an aid in improving grammar, the use of particles, and sounding more natural. For instance, I personally maintain an Excel sheet where I copy the phrases and learn one new phrase every day.

I haven't encountered many drawbacks in the past 2 years of using it, but like everything else out there, it may not be for everyone. However, you won’t know unless you give it a try and consistency is vital.

- A fast and effective method to study Kanji.
- Makes Kanji recognition through radicals easier.
- Fun, comprehensive, and engaging.
- An easy way to maintain and increase vocabulary.
- Payment required.

## 3. Jisho

**Topic:** Dictionary App/Website, Word lists, JLPT
**Link:** [Jisho](https://jisho.org/)

You probably saw this one coming, but the list would be incomplete without it. Personally, this app is one of the best dictionary apps I have used, especially considering there are others out there that are just as good. Take "Japanese," for example. What sets this app apart is its user-friendly interface, the breakdown of lists based on the frequency of kanji/words, categorized by JLPT level, and the inclusion of example sentences for each vocabulary. The other word lists include expressions (idiomatic and proverbs), slangs and dialects, colloquialisms, obsolete terms, words usually written in kana alone and so much more. While these features are not uncommon, I feel like Jisho somehow does it better. Additionally, the website is a plus as it allows for easy access to your account and the ability to look up words while working on your computer or laptop.

- User-friendly interface
- Available on both website and app
- Access to unlimited word lists for learning
- JLPT kanji and vocabulary lists included
- Flashcards feature
- Free of charge

## 4. Learn Japanese 先生

**Topic:** App/Website, Grammar, Vocabulary, Textbook, Blog
**Link:** [Learn Japanese Sensei (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/learn-japanese-sensei/id1495789984) | [Learn Japanese Sensei (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.japanactivator.android.jasensei&hl=en&gl=US)

This app version Tae Kim's *Guide to Learning Japanese* is one of the best grammar guides available. It is a valuable resource that can be used no matter your Japanese proficiency. Unlike most textbooks that teach Japanese using the grammatical structure of English, this book follows the "Japanese through Japanese" learning approach, making it a unique and effective tool for language learning.

If you are unsure about purchasing the book or want to get a feel for it, this app is a great tool to do just that. Its availability on both mobile and laptop makes learning much easier and highly accessible. The step-by-step guide is specifically tailored for beginners, making it user-friendly and easy to navigate.

One aspect of the guide that I found challenging as an absolute beginner was the abundance of Kanji characters presented without their English meaning. This meant that I had to look up the meaning of each individual Kanji. However, this is where the app proves to be useful, as it simplifies the process of looking up the meaning or tapping on a Kanji to retrieve its meaning. Overall, it is one of the best resources to begin with and make a strong start.

- Suitable for absolute beginners
- Provides clear and simple explanations of grammar
- Easy to use for all users
- Free of charge

## 5. Organic Japanese with Cure Dolly

**Topic:** Youtube, Grammar, Vocabulary, Guides and Books
**Link:** [Cure Dolly's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkdmU8hGK4Fg3LghTVtKltQ)

A similar approach is taken by the anonymous YouTuber/”sentient, self-aware intelligence” who goes by the name Cure Dolly, whose content aims to make Japanese as simple as it really is.
Cure Dolly breaks down the semantics of Japanese as a language and provides easy-to-follow explanations of grammar within its fundamental context. The channel also offers hacks and tricks for learning Kanji or vocabulary more efficiently, giving its learners plenty of options to choose from.

One thing I noticed when I first started learning the language was that the explanations were a bit difficult to follow (maybe due to my lack of brain cells). They seemed too complex for a beginner who was completely new to the language's structure and mechanics. However, it is still a valuable resource to have if you prefer more contextual and logical explanations of Japanese.

Cure Dolly is also an author of several books in which she breaks down the language using logic and easy-to-follow instructions. One of the first books I bought when preparing for N5 was her “Alice in Kanji Land”, where she incorporates Spaced Repetition System (SRS) and presents an interesting approach to make Kanji learning easier. It is a great choice for individuals who enjoy stories and unique learning methods.

- Suitable for learners of all levels
- Includes grammar breakdowns and easy-to-follow explanations
- Emphasizes contextual learning
- Offers a unique approach to learning
- Free of charge

## 6. Yomu Jp

**Topic:** Website, Reading, Vocabulary, Culture, Knowledge, JLPT
**Link:** [Yomu Jp](https://yomujp.com/)

For those looking for a level-appropriate resource to improve your reading skills, Yomu Jp is just the place. What makes it interesting is that the articles are divided based on the difficulty level corresponding to the JLPT, both in terms of grammar and vocabulary. Each article varies in subject matter from level to level. For instance, the articles listed in N4 would have subjects or stories that are easier to comprehend compared to those found in N1, which are intended for a more advanced audience.

Additionally, they have a level designed for absolute beginners who want to jump right into practicing reading their kana with very simple words and sentences, or for those who want to expand their vocabulary. Regardless of your reading level, Yomu Jp has something for you. The articles cover a wide range of topics, from Japanese culture and society to anything that makes for a fun and informative read for language learners.

- Suitable for all levels of proficiency.
- Levels specifically designed for absolute beginners.
- Enhance your understanding of Japanese culture and society.
- User-friendly and intuitive.
- Ideal for individuals starting their reading journey.
- Free of charge

## 7. Kakimashou

**Topic:** Website, Dictionary, Kanji, JLPT, Vocabulary
**Link:** [Kakimashou](https://www.kakimashou.com/)

Dictionaries are fun, but Kakimashou takes it to the next level by focusing on memorizing kanji through writing. When you type in a word, it displays its meaning and provides a square grid with dotted lines, similar to genkouyoushi paper, for you to practice writing the kanji. You can choose to view the stroke order multiple times before attempting to write it yourself. The computer recognizes your strokes based on the accuracy of your writing. This method is more enjoyable than traditional paper practice, making it highly recommended.

It also provides a curriculum that includes kanji lists from JLPT, WaniKani, and vocabularies from textbooks such as Heisig's Remembering the Kanji, Genki, and others. The dictionary displays the breakdown of kanji by radical and indicates the frequency of each kanji's usage in everyday life.

Overall, this website is a valuable resource for learners of all levels, making the process of learning and writing kanji a bit easier.

- Kanji Learning and Kanji Writing Dictionary
- Vocabulary lists from popular websites and textbooks
- Suitable for all proficiency levels
- User-friendly and interactive
- Free of charge

## 8. JLPTPro

**Topic:** Website, JLPT, Grammar
**Link:** [JLPTPro](http://jlptpro.com/)

Discovering this website was truly one of the best things that happened to me right before my N3 exam. I would even go as far as admitting that without this website, it would have been a struggle to pass. It was one of the few resources I thoroughly relied on.

This website is specifically designed for the JLPT and provides dedicated content for grammar, vocabulary, and listening, categorized by each level. The videos are taught in a classroom format by native speakers who are JLPT certified. Despite the website's age, it is one of the best resources I have come across that is tailored to the exam.

The course starts with an introduction consisting of approximately 10 lessons, each of which are divided into grammar explanations and vocabulary lists. Some vocabularies are further explained to enhance your understanding within the context.

The reason this approach worked for me is that, given the limited timeframe before my exam, I couldn't afford to study from comprehensive and time-consuming textbooks like the Shin Kanzen or the Sou Matome series. That's where this website came in handy, and the small fee I had to pay to access the full content was definitely worth it.

- Designed for learners who are taking the JLPT.
- Class format videos.
- Easy-to-follow explanations.
- Includes mock tests.
- Requires payment.

## 9. Miku Real Japanese

**Topic:** Youtube, Podcast, Grammar, Vocabulary, Culture, Knowledge, Native Content, Fun
**Link:** [Miku Real Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/@mikurealjapanese)

If you are looking to learn natural grammar and vocabulary as spoken by a native speaker, then Miku Real Japanese should be your go-to resource. I discovered Miku Sensei's channel when I was around N4 level, and ever since then, my Japanese has improved significantly. She is also incredibly versatile and creates content for all levels.

Her main focus is to help her audience sound natural or "native-like," so the grammar and vocabulary she teaches come from commonly used everyday language rather than a textbook. She is greatly skilled at breaking down conjugations, grammar, and sentences to help you understand the language in context, and of course, she makes it a lot of fun too.

Miku Sensei also has a podcast that I highly recommend for beginners with a basic foundation to intermediate learners. Additionally, she offers a "Shadowing Course" and a "Transcript Service" for her podcast. While I have not personally used them, if you are willing to invest in quality content and make efficient progress in your language journey, I believe Miku Real Japanese should be your top choice.

- Beginner Friendly
- Learn commonly used grammar and vocabulary.
- Fun and educational content.
- Podcasts and additional services.
- JLPT grammar explanations.

## 10. Yuyu Nihongo Podcast

**Topic:** Podcast, Listening, Youtube, Transcript
**Link:** [Yuyu Nihongo Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@yuyunihongopodcast)

Okay, this one is a bit of a stretch, but this Youtube/Podcast is one of the few that I listen to quite often as an intermediate learner. It is one of my all-time go-to resources and stays true to the title of this article. I will write more about my favourite podcasters in detail later.

Listening is my second weakest skill after reading, but regularly listening to podcasts greatly helps with understanding the language in a cultural context as much as it serves a perfect tool to train your ears and brain in your target language. I remember listening to this podcast for months without understanding a single word, but once I felt confident with my N4 grammar, I started listening to it and haven’t stopped since. It has now become my primary resource for listening practice, regardless of how my day has been. He also speaks Spanish fluently, so if you are a Spanish speaker or are learning both languages, this is definitely a “two birds with one stone” moment.

While this podcast is designed for intermediate learners, even if you can only understand a few words and basic grammar, I highly recommend Yuyu Nihongo Podcast as a listening resource. You will be amazed at how quickly your Japanese skills can improve in a short amount of time.
