I recently found myself in a situation where I had just two and a half months before my N3 Japanese exam, and I was in a bit of a panic because my reading skills were far below average. I scoured the internet, trying to find the perfect book to help me tackle this section. While I had gathered a few resources for other sections, it seemed almost impossible to find a comprehensive one for reading. It's worth noting that I could have used the popular Shin Kanzen or Sou Matome series, but I simply didn't have the time or patience to work through them. Moreover, living in India, where Japanese learning resources are limited and often overpriced, made my quest even more challenging. With these circumstances in mind, I was fortunate enough to stumble upon a book that appeared to be the ideal companion for my last two months of intensive preparation. 

In this blog post, I aim to provide a thorough review of this book for two main reasons. Firstly, I couldn't find many reviews of this book online, which gave me pause before making the purchase. I hope that my review can be of help to someone else facing a similar dilemma. Secondly, I believe this book deserves a review because it not only helped me pass the reading section but almost ace it. Everyone has their unique study methods, but I'm here to share the approach that worked exceptionally well for me.

## "Points and Practice"

Before you decide to purchase this book, I'll provide some key information to give you a sense of what it's all about, as I did when I first considered it. The book consists of approximately 12 lessons, covering a variety of themes such as "written opinions," "emails," and "information retrieval." The passages vary in length, ranging from short to medium-sized to long. The primary goal is to equip you with the essential skills needed to understand the key points in the text and tackle the reading section efficiently. The 'points' in the book break down the sentences and offer shortcuts to make it easier and faster to locate the answer, even if you don't fully comprehend the entire passage. At the end of the book, you'll find an annex that includes answers and the points listed in the same order as the lessons.

Lessons one through five compile points that are fundamentally divided into "Connecting Phrases and Demonstratives" and "Omitting Subjects and Reasons." Lessons six through twelve focus on discerning and applying these points. For instance, the first two lessons cover "Connecting Phrases." These connecting phrases are designed to make the flow of sentences smoother and help you determine which part of the sentence requires more attention. For instance, phrases like "ところが," "つまり," and "それで" are considered connecting phrases. When any of these phrases appear in a sentence, it indicates that the sentences preceding or following them are more likely to be relevant. In the case of "ところが," the book explains that "後ろの方が大切。予想と違って驚いた、という気持ちを表すことが多い" (The section after "ところが" is more important; it often indicates feelings of surprise at the difference from expectations). Similarly, in the case of "それで," it clarifies that "それでの前に『理由』が、後に『結果』が書かれている" (The reason is written before "それで," and the result is written after). These points guide you in understanding which part of the sentence demands more attention and which part does not.

One bonus that I particularly appreciated was the alignment between the grammar explanations and the context in which they were presented. For example, "A。一方B" and "A。それに対し(て)B" both indicate a comparison between two contrasting elements. When you encounter these structures in a passage, it immediately draws your attention to the conflict in the sentence, allowing you to stay on track and not lose sight of what you need to look for. As you progress through each lesson, the themes and passages become gradually more complex, mirroring the variety of contexts you'll encounter in the actual exam. The book concludes with a mock test, giving you the opportunity to time yourself and put your skills and knowledge to the test.

In my opinion, "Points and Practice" is an excellent choice for those who are short on time or simply want to get accustomed to Japanese sentence patterns designed specifically for the JLPT. I thoroughly enjoyed using this book, although I found the longer passages to be more challenging to understand and tackle, especially given the relatively limited number of them compared to the shorter and medium-sized passages. This structural aspect was a drawback for me. However, it's worth noting that, in the end, I achieved an impressive score of 54 out of 60 on the exam, which I consider quite high given the time constraints and my initial lack of reading skills. While some might attribute my success to luck, I firmly believe that this book played a significant role in my performance. As a result, I would rate it a solid 4.5 out of 5.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- Concise and to the point.
- Easy-to-follow explanations that aid in quick comprehension.
- Ideal for self-study, especially if you're short on time.
- Includes a mock test to evaluate your progress.
- Tailored for the JLPT, making it highly relevant to the exam's requirements.

**Cons:**

- Explanations could have been more comprehensive in certain areas.
- The book lacks a sufficient number of long passages, with a heavier focus on shorter ones.
- While not exorbitant, the book's price might still be a concern for some, especially when compared to other resources available in India.

In conclusion, if you're preparing for the JLPT N3 and are looking for a resource to enhance your reading skills efficiently, "Points and Practice" could be an excellent addition to your study materials. Despite a few minor drawbacks, I can confidently say that this book significantly contributed to my success in the reading section of the exam. Give it a try, and I hope it works just as effectively for you!
