I have been teaching myself Japanese for almost three years now, and I must say it's been nothing but fun and I look forward to learning so much more. However, if someone were to ask me if they should do the same, I would most likely say no. Don't get me wrong, I am all for learning the language by yourself within the comforts of your room, but I do not encourage it. The reason I say this is because a lotta introverts, like myself, find it more comfortable and "safer" to start by teaching themselves the basics before testing their skills in the real world. And that's perfectly okay. Now, determining where the "basics" end is a different matter altogether. However, continuing to self-study Japanese beyond that point may undermine the purpose of learning it.

Anyone who has been studying Japanese for a while knows that it is a language that relies heavily on context. Therefore, applying what you learn in real-life situations becomes crucial. For example, it is essential to have a language partner to make self-sufficient progress. If you actively seek out fellow learners or mentors online, then hey, you are on the right track. Additionally, if you wanna take it a step further and join a language school, absolutely go for it. There isn't a better teacher than immersing yourself in an environment where you cannot escape the language. 

However, if you are a person who waits until the "perfect moment" to join a community or talk to a Japanese person online, I am sorry to say that the time is never gonna come. Waiting until you reach a "certain level of fluency" before starting to speak is just wishful thinking and you are only procrastinating actually studying the language. Of course, if you are preparing for the JLPT, you will need to use textbooks to prepare for it. However, it's important to realize that real learning happens outside of it.

Now, you may have guessed why I am writing this. I decided to study Japanese full-time because my dream is to work with the language, specifically as a translator. While there are still plenty of opportunities and people to connect with, studying a language as extensive as Japanese can get awfully lonely without someone to do it with you. Isn't the whole point of learning to actually use it? I don't regret teaching myself Japanese from scratch, but I do regret the fact that I did not put myself out there sooner. 

The only thing that builds the gap between you and the language is the way you approach it. I don't want you guys to make the same mistake as I did by not being part of an online community or enrolling yourself in classes. Put yourself out there more. It can be as simple as having regular conversations with fellow learners on Discord, connecting with someone on Langmate or Hello Talk, or even taking trial lessons on iTalki. While it's never too late when it comes to language learning, it's better to do it sooner rather than later. It is you who should have the power to decide, not the language. 

Don't be afraid of what your Japanese sounds like to others, because taking the first step is always the hardest and you've already taken it. This already puts you ahead of many other learners. So, I strongly encourage you to put yourself out there and start exploring approaches that work best for you, instead of going through the learning process alone. There is no wrong way to learn Japanese, but there are more people out there who can help you find the right mindset to enhance your knowledge for the better. Happy learning, ya'll!
